In 2024, React is still the #1 skill to learn if you want to become a successful front-end developer!

But it can be hard. There are so many moving parts, so many different libraries, so many tutorials out there.

That's why you came here... And you came to the right place! This is **THE** ultimate React course for 2024 and beyond.

**_A practice-heavy approach to master React by building polished apps, backed up by diagrams, theory, and looks under the hood of React._**

The all-in-one package that takes you from zero to truly understanding React and building modern, powerful, and professional web applications.

Real projects. Real explanations. Real React.

**\[01\] Why is this the right React course for you?**

This is the most **epic** React (+ Next.js) course on Udemy, and it's **fundamentally different from all the other ones**.

Here's why:

- Contains **the biggest and most professional project**, where we implement many common app features (see promo video!)
- **Super detailed explanations** of all important concepts with carefully crafted and animated diagrams
- A huge focus on "**how to think in React**" and **modern best practices**
- A long section that explores **how React actually works behind the scenes** will give you the confidence to use React effectively on your own
- **Advanced design patterns** like compound components will make you think like a senior React engineer
- Many sections (16 hours!) on **Next.js with the modern "app" router** (with React Server Components and Server Actions)

And these are just the highlights! Check out the full list below (+ the promo video and curriculum).

Also, make no mistake: "React course" actually means "Front-end development with React and modern libraries course".

_That's right, besides the React library itself, you will learn and master them all: React Router, Redux, Redux Toolkit, React Query, React Hook Form, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS,_ **_Next.js_**_, and more._

_This is how we plan, build, and deploy professional projects! We even use industry-standard tools such as Supabase (fully-fledged back-end), GitHub, Netlify, and Vercel._

As you expect, this course is 100% project-based. So throughout the course, you'll start building your portfolio of 10+ beautiful and high-quality React apps, where each one will showcase a few of the new skills you will be learning.

**_By the end of the course, you will have all the knowledge and confidence that you need to ace your job interviews and become the professional React developer that companies are looking for._**
